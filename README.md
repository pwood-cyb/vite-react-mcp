A Vite plugin that creates an MCP server to help LLMs understand your React App context

## Features

- `highlight-component`
  - description: Highlight React component based on the component name.
  - params: 
    - `componentName`: string

- `get-component-states`
  - description: Get the React component props, states, and contexts in JSON structure format.
  - params:
    - `componentName`: string

- `get-component-tree`
  - description: Get the React component tree of the current page in ASCII format.
  - params:
    - `allComponent`: boolean, if truthy, return a tree for all components instead of your self-defined components only.

- `get-unnecessary-rerenders`
  - description: Get the wasted re-rendered components of the current page.
  - params:
    - `timeframe`: number, if present, only get unnecessary renders within the last `timeframe` seconds. If not, get all unnecessary renders happened on the current page.
    - `allComponent`: boolean, if truthy, get unnecessary renders for all components instead of self-defined components only.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
bun add -d vite-react-mcp @babel/preset-react
```

### Usage

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import ReactMCP from 'vite-react-mcp'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [ReactMCP()],
  server: { host: true, port: 3001 }, // pick the port you want
})
```

At this point, you already can access `window.__VITE_REACT_MCP_TOOLS__` to use the tools in Developer panel on your browser.

To use it as an MCP server, setup MCP configuration in your MCP client.

- For Cursor, create a `./cursor/mcp.json` at the root level of your react project.

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "vite-react-mcp": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3000/sse"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Make sure the port is the same as your react app.

- For Claude Desktop, it requires a bit of workaround. If you are interested, you can take a look at [this thread](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/16).

  The reason is Claude MCP Client does execution based on command, while what we have here is HTTP based API. You need to write a script acting as a bridge to make it look like execution based.

- Any MCP client can also discover the server via the manifest exposed at:
  - `http://localhost:<port>/.well-known/vite-react-mcp.json`
  - SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:<port>/sse`
  - Message endpoint: `http://localhost:<port>/messages`


### How it works

MCP exposes a tool-call api through natural language. The tool itself is injected on your browser runtime. 
It works without requiring React Devtools extension, as we use `bippy`, which injects a `__REACT_GLOBAL_DEVTOOLS_HOOK__`
to `window`. The tool then is triggered from vite's websocket call to do corresponding actions by receiving mcp tool call 
command from the mcp client you interact.
